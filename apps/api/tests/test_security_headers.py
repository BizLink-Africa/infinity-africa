"""app/middleware/security_headers.py — MVP security-hardening pass. Every
response from this API carries a standard set of defensive headers; see
that module's own docstring for why Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy and
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy are deliberately NOT among them (this API is
consumed cross-origin, by design, from apps/web).

Swagger/OpenAPI docs being reachable at all is itself environment-gated —
see test_settings.py's docs_enabled tests for that; this file only confirms
the headers on an ordinary response, and that the CSP is skipped on the
docs paths themselves (which need their own inline scripts/styles).
